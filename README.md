# Matcha

## ðŸš€ About the project 

This project aims to create a dynamic dating website, guiding users from the initial registration process to the final, exciting encounter. Our platform is enriched with features such as video chat to provide a more interactive and engaging user experience.

- Under the hood, Matcha is powered by a robust tech stack. We've leveraged Flask, a lightweight yet powerful Python web framework, for our backend. In an effort to optimize database interactions and maintain full control over our queries, we've chosen not to use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system. Instead, we've written all SQL queries manually using Psycopg, a popular PostgreSQL adapter for Python. This approach allows us to handle user requests efficiently and securely, while ensuring maximum flexibility and performance in our database operations.

- On the frontend, we've chosen React with TypeScript to build a responsive, user-friendly interface. To enhance the visual appeal and usability of our application, we've utilized Chakra UI, a simple, modular and accessible component library that provides a range of customizable UI elements. TypeScript provides a static type system, enhancing code quality and maintainability.

- We've chosen PostgreSQL as our database management system due to its reliability, robust feature set, and strong community support. Here is a small schema of our database.
